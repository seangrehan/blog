Then take your dough from your mixing bowl and put back on your lightly dusted clean work surface and fold each corner into the middle and flip over to keep the shape intact; should look like a cylinder. Leave your loaf under your tea towel until the oven has completely heated up. Carefully remove the dutch oven from the oven and put on a safe place on your work surface. Take the lid off and dust the bottom with some flour to prevent sticking, carefully tranfer your loaf into the Dutch Oven and spray with clean water, then put the lid back on and out into the oven for 25 minutes.<\/p>"
